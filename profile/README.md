## Team Activities 

[Team Activities](https://github.com/CS5004-khoury-lionelle/TeamActivities) are peer ran labs and can easily be converted to a standard lab. 

## Homework Assignments

The ordering of the homeworks can vary a bit each semester, but this is a running list for homeworks. For the homework
assignments, we look at two week windows for each assignment. More tha one homework, means 
I have a couple options that I developed, but probably only selected one option for the particular semester.

Homeworks have an autograded and manually graded portion, and are based on formative / grading for equity grading styles.
